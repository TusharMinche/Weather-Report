# Weather Report

The Weather Report website is a simple project built to learn how to use APIs. Using the OpenWeatherMap API, the website prompts users to input a location of their choice and displays the current weather report for that location. While the website has no user interface to speak of, it serves as an excellent learning tool for understanding the fundamentals of API usage. If you're interested in learning how to leverage APIs to build powerful applications, the Weather Report website is an excellent project to explore.
